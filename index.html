        Hello Folks! My name is Deepali and I am 30 years old. I am an IT Engineer & QA Analyst by profession. Lately I have been working on few projects like AI Chatbot, Voting App, Financial Trackers, Building LLM agent using ADK, etc. I am job hunting as of now, thus upskilling myself until then. I am proficient in English & Hindi. I love to play raqcuet sports and do my gym workouts.
